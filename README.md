Anno is a simple, lightweight, and local note-taking program. 


# Motivation

- I want to own my data, not have it siloed by a company.
- I want to human-readable text files (Markdown + MathJax), not a proprietary file format.
- I want to work locally and backup as I choose (e.g. a remote Git server).

## Limitations

Writing good user interfaces is hard and time-consuming, and I want to take notes, not maintain software. My goal is to build a UI to support the most time consuming text-editing operations such as...

- ...previewing Markdown and MathJax updates as I write.
- ...organizing my notes based on labels.
- ...converting a note into a PDF for easy printing and sharing.
- ...uploading images the correct Markdown format.
- ...syncing the file date with the filename.

This also means that there is no support for things I just _occasionally_ do, such as...

- ...searching. Use `grep`, `ack`, or your favorite text search tool.
- ...viewing the archive or trash. Use your OS's file manager.
- ...moving files out of the archive. Use your OS's file manager.
