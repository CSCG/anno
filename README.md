Anno is a simple, lightweight, and local note-taking program. 


# Motivation

- I want to own my data, not have it siloed by a company.
- I want to human-readable text files (Markdown + MathJax), not a proprietary file format.
- I want to work locally and backup as I choose (e.g. a remote Git server).
- I want to take notes, not maintain software; the latter should be simple.
