Anno is a simple, lightweight, and local note-taking program. 


# Motivation

- I want to own my data.
- I want to work locally but backup to a remote git repo.
- I want my data to exist as human-readable files; the UI is a mirror of the filesystem.
- I want to write in Markdown + MathJax.
- I want to take notes, not maintain software. This should be as stupidly simple as possible.
