Anno is a thin user interface on Markdown files for easy, local editing and organization.


# Why use Anno?

There are many note-taking apps. Why use Anno?

- **Own your data.** Anno works on Markdown files that live on your machine. That's it. Rather than have your notes siloed by a company in a possibly proprietary text format, your data lives in human-readable text on your computer.

- **Work locally.** Want to work on a plane or a train? Want a fast user interface that isn't constantly pinging a remote server for who knows what? Anno is entirely local. It simply makes interacting with your data easier.

- **Control your history and backups.** Revision control and redundancy for text files is a solved problem, and Anno doesn't introduce more overhead. Want daily backups? Write a cron job. Want cloud storage? Zip the directory and drop it on another machine. Want revision control? Use Git. This is your data, not Anno's.

# What Anno supports

Anno supports the most common and/or time-consuming text-editing operations such as:

- Previewing changes as you write.
- Syncing Markdown header information (title and date) into consistently formatted filenames.
- Organizing notes based on labels specified in the Markdown header.
- Converting notes into PDFs for easy printing and sharing.
- Adding images to notes.

# Limitations

Anno is designed for technical people. This means there is no support for things you might occasionally do that you can do from the command line or your OS's file manager such as:

- There is no search. Use `grep`, `ack`, or your favorite text search tool.
- There is no interface for archived or trashed files. "Archiving" or "trashing" a note means moving it into a separate directory on your machine. Want to undo this operation or look through old notes? Use your OS's file manager.
