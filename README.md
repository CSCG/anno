Anno is a simple, lightweight, and local note-taking program. 


# Motivation

- I want to own my data, not have it siloed by a company.
- I want to human-readable text files (Markdown + MathJax), not a proprietary file format.
- I want to work locally and backup as I choose (e.g. a remote Git server).

## Limitations

Writing good user interfaces is hard and time-consuming, and I want to take notes, not maintain software. My goal is to build a UI to support 80% of my text-editing operations. What's time consuming? Things like...

- ...when I update a document date, I want the filename date updated as well.
- ...when I create an image, I don't want to remember the Markdown syntax for the caption, the width, and so forth.

That said, there is no support for things I just _occasionally_ do. For example:

- No search. Use `grep`, etc.
- No archive viewer. Just open the files with `sublime`, etc.
- No way to move files out of the archive or trash. Use Finder, etc.
